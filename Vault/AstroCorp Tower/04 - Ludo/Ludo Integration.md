### **Ludo Integration: The Artifact's Influence**

#### **Setup:**

- Place a physical Ludo board on the table. Assign each player a token and one for the GM, representing the artifact's growing influence or the encroaching eldritch entity.
- Players and the GM take turns rolling a die for their tokens. The GM's rolls occur at specific points, such as after significant narrative events, while the players roll during key actions or as rewards for good roleplay and successes.

#### **Mechanics:**

1. **Player Movement:**
    
    - Players advance on the Ludo board as a reward for completing objectives, solving puzzles, defeating enemies, or roleplaying effectively.
    - If a player achieves a critical success (or similar accomplishment), they can gain additional rolls.
2. **GM/Artifact Movement:**
    
    - The GM rolls whenever an event occurs that increases the artifact's power (e.g., activating an ancient mechanism, a failed ritual interruption, or a summoned creature appearing).
    - The GM also rolls whenever the players' actions inadvertently aid the artifact's agenda or when the players fail a major task.
3. **Setbacks:**
    
    - If the GM's token overtakes a player's token on the Ludo board, that player suffers a setback in the game. This could manifest as:
        - Losing a crucial item or resource.
        - Suffering a temporary debuff, such as reduced sanity or impaired physical ability.
        - Being forced to backtrack in the narrative (e.g., getting trapped or separated from the group).
    - The player's token is also moved back to the GM's last position on the board.
4. **Boosts:**
    
    - If players collectively "pass" the GM on the board, they earn a boon, such as:
        - Insight into the artifact's nature.
        - Extra resources (ammo, health kits, etc.).
        - A one-time narrative advantage, like escaping a dangerous room or bypassing a trap.

#### **Winning the Ludo Game:**

- If a player's token reaches the Ludo goal first, they gain a significant narrative advantage, such as discovering a way to neutralize the artifact or reaching the rooftop extraction point before the entity fully manifests.
- If the GM reaches the goal first, the artifact's power fully activates, leading to catastrophic consequences (e.g., summoning the alien entity or fully warping reality).

---

#### **Balancing Gameplay:**

- Use the Ludo mechanic sparingly to avoid disrupting immersion. Tie the dice rolls to key moments in the narrative for maximum impact.
- The board serves as a visual representation of the stakes, with the playersâ€™ tokens symbolizing progress and the GM's token embodying the escalating danger.

This physical element adds tension and gives players a tactile reminder of their stakes. It also gives you, as the GM, a fun and interactive way to dynamically adjust the pacing and difficulty of the session. How does this sound?
