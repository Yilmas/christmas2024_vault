#### Setting:

The game takes place in a towering corporate skyscraper, **AstroCorp Tower**, a monolithic structure that looms over the city. It's Christmas Eve, and the building is hosting its annual gala, a luxurious celebration for the company's executives, employees, and their families. However, beneath the glittering lights and holiday cheer, AstroCorp is hiding dark secrets.

#### Premise:

Unbeknownst to the partygoers, AstroCorp's upper floors house a top-secret research facility. The company has been experimenting with ancient alien artifacts recovered from a distant planet. During the festivities, a security breach occurs. An unknown group (posing as thieves) storms the building, claiming to want AstroCorp's treasures.

However, something far worse happens: the artifact activates. It begins to warp reality, unleashing monstrous entities and driving people mad. The party is trapped inside the tower, which is now a labyrinthine maze of shifting corridors, alien horrors, and maddened survivors.

#### Players' Role:

The players are an eclectic mix of individuals who were present for the gala:

See: Link

#### Objectives:

1. **Survive:** Navigate the ever-changing tower while avoiding or combating alien creatures and deranged partygoers.
2. **Investigate:** Uncover the truth about AstroCorp's experiments and the artifact's purpose.
3. **Escape:** Reach the rooftop helipad to signal for extraction or activate a failsafe device to neutralize the artifact.

#### Challenges:

- **Eldritch Transformations:** Certain areas of the tower are "contaminated," causing hallucinations, time loops, or gravity distortions.
- **Unstable Artifact:** As time passes, the artifact grows more powerful, summoning larger creatures and worsening the reality shifts.
- **Hostile Forces:** The thieves are cultists who worship the alien being the artifact is connected to. They're trying to complete a ritual to summon it fully.
- **Moral Dilemmas:** Survivors beg for help, but saving them might jeopardize the group's chances of survival.

#### Climactic Twist:

The artifact is revealed to be a "beacon," and a massive alien entity is en route to claim it. The players must decide whether to destroy the artifact (risking catastrophic consequences), escape and let someone else deal with it, or attempt to negotiate with the entity—if their sanity holds.

#### Christmas Flavor:

- The gala decorations contrast eerily with the growing horror, like a blood-smeared Santa costume or a shattered Christmas tree in a hauntingly quiet room.
- The final showdown could involve the helipad, where the swirling snow and Christmas lights create a surreal backdrop for their fight against the alien cult leader.

**Session Introduction**

The glint of shimmering ornaments and the soft hum of Christmas carols fill the air as you step into the grand ballroom atop the AstroCorp Tower. It’s a scene plucked from a holiday postcard—a colossal tree adorned with gold and silver baubles dominates the center of the room, while servers glide between clusters of guests, their trays laden with glasses of champagne and seasonal hors d'oeuvres.

Through the enormous glass walls, the city sprawls below, twinkling with festive lights. The atmosphere is electric, with laughter and chatter echoing in the expansive space. Executives, socialites, and AstroCorp’s elite mingle, all unaware that beneath the polished façade of this celebration, something ancient and unspeakable stirs.

Far below the tower, in a secret lab hidden from prying eyes, a barrier is about to break. The festivities will soon become a fight for survival. The elegant décor will twist into a nightmare, and the shimmering Christmas lights will pale against the eldritch horrors that seep into this world.

Tonight, you’re not just partygoers or employees. Tonight, you’ll become survivors—if you’re lucky.

The clock ticks down. Somewhere deep within the tower, something awakens. And it’s hungry.

Welcome to AstroCorp Tower. Your holiday nightmare begins now.
