### **Greater Tome of the Veil**

**Appearance:**  
The tome is an ancient leather-bound book, its cover cracked and weathered with age. Strange, pulsating runes glow faintly along its spine. The pages are brittle, inked with dark crimson that glimmers under certain light angles. Touching the book feels unnervingly warm, and a low hum emanates from it when opened.

**Opening Inscription:**  
_"Let the veil remain untouched, the gate remain sealed. Those who seek knowledge must do so at their peril, for the cost is dearer than the truth it reveals."_

### **Ritual of Sealing: "The Ward of Eternal Shadows"**

**Components Needed:**

1. A source of pure light (e.g., a powerful flashlight, glow crystal, or similar object).
2. A physical link to the artifact (e.g., a shard or residue of its material).
3. A sacrificial offering (this could be a physical object of great personal value or, in dire cases, a willing life).
4. A sanctified space (designated by carving the protective runes found in the tome).

**Preparation Steps:**

1. Carve the **Glyph of Binding** (pictured on page 112 of the tome) in a perfect circle around the artifact.
2. Place the source of pure light in the center of the glyph, directly touching the artifact.
3. Hold the link to the artifact in your hand, focusing your mind on the energy radiating from it.

**Incantation:**  
_This chant must be spoken in unison by all participants:_

_"From shadow into shadow, we deny your return.  
From gate unto void, we sever the tether.  
By the light eternal, we seal your call.  
By the cost paid freely, we end this all."_ 

The final line must be repeated three times, with the light source growing brighter at each repetition.

---

**Outcome:**

- If the ritual is completed successfully, the artifact will emit a blinding flash of light, and all eldritch influences within its radius will be banished.
- However, the sanctity of the space will collapse immediately after, leaving participants drained and forcing Corruption Saves to resist lingering effects.

**Warning:**  
The tome notes that the artifact is inherently unstable and may resist the ritual. Players must complete it within a limited number of rounds (GM discretion). Failure to do so could result in the artifact releasing its full power, leading to catastrophic consequences.
