_"Date: December 21st, 2024_  
We've traced the artifact's origins to an uncharted section of the ocean floor. Initial scans suggest its composition predates known history—an impossibility by all scientific measures. The runes etched into its surface resonate with frequencies not detectable on any traditional spectrum, suggesting an otherworldly origin.

Despite its dormant state, proximity experiments have revealed a disturbing trend: prolonged exposure leads to hallucinations and erratic behavior among staff. We must proceed with caution. I fear we’ve underestimated its potential to influence the mind."

_"Addendum: Following yesterday’s unexpected energy surge, we’ve relocated the artifact to the Containment Chamber in the sub-basement. Access is restricted to essential personnel only. There is more to this thing than we can comprehend."_
