**Artifact Observation Log**  
**Entry #117 - Researcher: Dr. Eli Moran**

*"The artifact's influence extends beyond its physical presence. Recent experiments reveal localized distortions in time flow. Recorded observations include clocks running backward, test subjects reporting fragmented memories, and brief glimpses of alternate realities through reflective surfaces.

Its spatial anomalies are equally unsettling. Corridors near the artifact stretch or contract unpredictably, and physical objects left close to it occasionally vanish, reappearing minutes—or hours—later in impossible configurations.

Conclusion: The artifact is not bound by our understanding of linear time or stable dimensions. Caution is imperative. I fear we are tampering with forces far beyond human comprehension."*
