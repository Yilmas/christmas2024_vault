**Containment Log - Final Entry**  
**Dr. Celeste Marlowe - Lead Scientist**

*"This is my final log. The artifact is not a relic—it’s a key. Its resonance aligns perfectly with ancient cosmic frequencies, acting as a beacon to something far older and infinitely more powerful. We theorized it could unlock immense energy or technology, but we were wrong.

It’s a gateway. A signal. It calls to Them—the Elders who wait beyond the veil. The artifact’s activation is irreversible, and the veil between dimensions is thinning. Their influence has already begun seeping through. We’ve seen it in the corrupted staff, the spatial distortions, the time anomalies.

If you’ve found this log, know this: destroying the artifact is futile. It’s a seed, planted in our reality. It can only be contained... at great cost."*
