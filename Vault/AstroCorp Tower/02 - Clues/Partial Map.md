**Clue: Partial Map of the Sub-Basement**

A torn, coffee-stained piece of paper found amidst scattered files in the **Records Archive**. The crude map shows an outline of the sub-basement, marked with the following key features:

1. **Artifact Containment Chamber** circled in red with the note: “ACCESS RESTRICTED - LEVEL SIGMA.”
2. Scribbled arrows point to maintenance tunnels labeled “Emergency Escape Route?”
3. A jagged line cuts through part of the map, marked “Structural Weakness” near the stairwell.
4. Faint notes in the margins read:
    - “Energy readings strongest here.”
    - “Red Queen overrides required.”
