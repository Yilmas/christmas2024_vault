**Diary Entry (Scrawled in Shaking Handwriting):**

*"I can hear it now, whispering in the walls. It started as a dull hum, like the building was breathing, but now it’s louder. It knows I’m here. It sees me even when I close my eyes.

My colleagues... they’re not them anymore. Something twisted their faces, their bodies. I hid under the bunk as they tore through the others, but I can’t stay here forever.

It’s calling to me. The artifact. I dream about it every time I close my eyes. Maybe if I go to it, this will all make sense. Maybe it will stop. Or maybe... I’ll stop."*
