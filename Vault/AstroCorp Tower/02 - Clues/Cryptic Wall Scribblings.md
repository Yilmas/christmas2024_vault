**Cryptic Wall Scribblings:**  
The wall is covered in an uneven scrawl, written in what seems to be a mix of dried blood and an oily black substance. Some symbols are clearly alien, pulsating faintly, while fragments of translated text appear interspersed:

- “The door is a circle... the key is within.”
- “Time loops and bends... He waits on the other side.”
- “Do not look too long into the light—it sees you too.”
- “We are shadows in its dream.”

A successful roll to decipher the text reveals:  
_"The artifact is a beacon, calling something vast and ancient. The lines between worlds weaken as it awakens."_
